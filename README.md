# Recommendation System

"A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications."

Have you ever wondered how Netflix, or Amazon, knows what you want to watch or buy before you yourself even know? Well, it is based on what other people have watched or bought before you, who have similar tastes. This project demonstrates how a recommendation system similar to what Netflix might use works. This is very useful in a business sense because you can save time and money on advertising and getting people to buy things that they do not even need.
